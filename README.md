## Test
Test code is included in file. If you dominate jest, and can help me with the errors, I will be greatly thankfull. This project was specially hard to make all the npm modules work, and jest wasn't compatible with some of them. Feel free to contact me at my email `trevta@gmail.com` if you can figure out how to make this work. üòÅ
